            <div class="right story">
              <p>My father grew up all over the city. When he met my Southern Californian mother, they married and became hippie Christian ministers here, and over the course of 35 years, they ended up leading the largest congregation in the city. But at first, we lived in a commune. Then, my parents found a spot near Lake Merced with a big backyard and rope swings and chickens and goats. Yup, goats. I was homeschooled and so was able to graduate “high school” early and go to college at 16. I didn’t study much about what I do now, but that’s when I began investing my time into learning how the internet worked. My best friend Levi and I built our first websites together—a SWATCH™ sales portal and a corporate website for his brother’s climbing gym company. It felt like magic, then, to make money building things that lived on the internet.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="time-period learning-to-hustle">
            <div class="left story">
              <p>So, after school, that’s what I did. Working as a contractor starting in the early 2000s, I learned to apply my meager skills in HTML, Javascript, PHP and Photoshop to make my way in the world. In those early days, I did everything, all the time. In retrospect, it may look like I was hustling, but I was simply bursting with creative energy and willing to learn new things (and work for cheap!). So I learned how to build websites, marketing campaigns, brands and identities and a whole host of other skills.</p>

              <p>I tried to start a couple of companies with friends. We had big dreams for the second company, Thoughtpool. Our products languished after our runway disappeared, so we hustled and focused on making money, instead.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right portfolio"></div>
          </div>
          <div class="time-period designing-an-incubator">
            <div class="left portfolio"></div>
            <div class="right story">
              <p>After we decided to discontinue working on Thoughtpool, I spent some more time contracting. One night, I was reading online and stumbled across Carrotmob. The idea of a buycot was so compelling that I reached out to the founder, Brent Schulkin, to offer my services. It turned out that Brent was teaming up with Steve Newcomb, an entrepreneur, to turn Carrotmob and a couple of other services into a new company called Virgance. I joined the founding team in the late summer of 2008. It was at Virgance that I earned my stripes. Virgance was an incubator for socially good companies. At this point in time, incubators weren’t the hip thing they are today, but the people we reached out to loved the idea: Let’s radically transform capitalism and the way business is conducted. Virgance had a special ownership structure, the goal of which was to promote the growth of individual businesses as entities within a larger ecosystem. Anyway, the whole world felt at that time, much as it does today, on the verge of a great tipping point. The iPhone had just come out, Obama had just been elected: The world was ready for what we were building.</p>

              <p>We started out with four business units. Carrotmob, 1BOG, Green Options Media, Lend and Greenfund. I was the sole designer and front end developer for most of these products, and I felt like a kid in a candy store. Over the next few years, I would work on everything from novel voting interfaces for volunteers around the globe to designing a blogging platform for green bloggers. With Carrotmob, I was able to design and build a Instant Runoff Voting platform. With Lend, I designed and built an incredible Facebook game and were able to work with big brands—though it never ended up going anywhere. There was Slivergiver, which was a noble attempt at exploiting a loophole in Amazon’s referral business. With Greenfund, we did more work with spreadsheets—the goal was to make a virtuous investment ecosystem. Green Options Media served up millions of pageviews a month at its peak, and I had my hands in all of it. Then there was One Block Off the Grid (1BOG). At this point, we were a team of about 20 people. We’d raised an angel round and our Series A, and that summer, I think we had almost 40 interns. Things were blowing up. But they were blowing up primarily in one area of the company.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="time-period growing-a-solar-company">
            <div class="left story">
              <p>After a year and a half, it became clear that 1BOG was the best company out of our portfolio, and most of the team was working on it full time. I was making everything from solar calculators to CRM tools to full spread newspaper advertisements. We were nationwide and getting tens of thousands of new members a month. People were so excited about what we were doing; they were literally volunteering their time to help spread the word. We even hired someone who worked on the Obama campaign to manage them. He was awesome. Seriously. 1BOG was so good, in fact, that when funding dried up in 2011 after Solyndra, we had to trim the fat. It was a terrible time for the team: many people split away at that point, each business unit being given to the stakeholders so that they could continue to operate independently. But 1BOG absorbed almost everybody. With a new, slimmer team and a crystal-clear vision, we began the quest to become the most trusted name in solar.</p>

              <p>Over the next four years, I worked on almost every part of the company. I designed several versions of: the website, the internal tools, the solar calculator, the quoting tools, vendor tools and so on. I also had the privilege of working on animations, commercials, billboards and print ads of all kinds. I even designed several iterations of our call center of 50 solar advisors and salespeople. Even though we were laser focused on solar by this point, I still felt like that kid in the candy store: every day, there were so many new and interesting challenges to troubleshoot and overcome. Because we were lean, we had to work smart and be resourceful. Working side by side with Dave Llorens, the founder and at this point CEO of 1BOG, was a daily exercise in resourcefulness. We did everything in-house, and we did it well. And we saved tens of thousands of dollars not hiring agencies.</p>

              <p>Despite funding challenges, we continued to grow. We were doing really well, but our money was running out. We were determined to not let what we had built go to waste, and so began to look outside the valley for a partner. The partner we found was in a place that was, at the time, an unlikely place for a solar company: Toronto, Canada.</p>

            <div class="left portfolio"></div>
            <div class="right story">
              <p>In 2013, 1BOG merged with PURE Energies. We raised some more money and poured jet fuel into the engine we had built. The business grew rapidly. Over the next year and a half, we really took off, growing from 70 to almost 200 by the beginning of 2015. That’s when we were acquired by NRG for a not-so-small wad of cash. Seven years! It had been seven long years since I’d started out on this journey with Virgance and 1BOG, and I needed a break. I resigned not too long before my birthday and bid farewell to a team with whom I’d spent more of my waking life than with anyone else.</p>

              <p>I took some time off, but I can’t not work on something. So I’m back to contracting. I’ve done work on a bunch of really interesting stuff. I was able to work with IDEO on a top secret project, with an index fund designing and building a reporting and analytics tool and a bunch of other small- and medium-sized projects. One of my favorite projects has been helping my dad with the internet side business he’s been building for the last 15 years. All that brings us to today! So what am I doing now?</p>

                <p>I've worked on many products and brought a few from inception all the way to market and beyond. The last company I helped build from the ground up recently sold for over $100m.</p>
                <p>It may seem trite to say, but I really do approach every challenge while wearing the user's shoes. Once you spend enough time in those shoes, you realize that most of the time, a good product is a good experience, and designing great experiences is something I excel at.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>Designing helpful and intuitive interfaces is pretty much my favorite type of work. Each product is a riddle without an answer, and the process of teasing out the most effective way to communicate to users and help them to accomplish shared goals is something I relish.</p>
                <p>Because I enjoy interface and interaction design so much, it's naturally where I've acquired large portion of my practical skillset. I've designed interfaces for people from all walks of life.</p>

                <p>I learned to turn my designs into products early on. I have a broad range of skills that allow me to take something from idea stage to production-ready.</p>
                <p>My main strengths are in front-end web development, but I've built products across many different platforms.</p>
                <p>My code is really good for a designer with no CS background, and I know all of the standard trade tools.</p>

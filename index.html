              <h1>I help make<br>dreams come true</h1>
              <p>I'm an artist, interface designer, and front end developer in San Francisco. I've spent the last 7 years making the dream of a successful solar company come true, and now I'm looking for my next mission.</p>
              <p>What's your dream? Maybe I can help you. <a class="orange-btn nav-item" href="#skills">Find out how</a></p>

                <h1>Am I a unicorn?</h1>
                <p>No -- at least I'm not <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/decacorn-is-the-new-unicorn-2015-3" target="_blank">that kind</a> of unicorn. I do have a set of skills that enable me to perform many of the jobs necessary for getting a digital product to market, though.</p>
                <p>The idea for the unicorn came from an email discussion where I had asked my friend Suelyn for advice on how to describe my broad set of skills. She pointed out that some people would classify me as a "unicorn designer": I can make the designs and then make them production-ready.</p>
                <p>I thought, hey that's great: I can draw a unicorn to explain what I do. Problem solved. Suelyn's email was so helpful I've asked for her to include it here -- it's great advice to any designer, but was invaluable to me.</p>
                <p>Thanks, Suelyn!</p>

                    <span>From <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suelynyu" target="_blank">Suelyn Yu - Frog Design, Opower</a> in response to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronbrodeur">Aaron Brodeur</a></span>

                  <div class="content">
                    <p>Hey Aaron-</p>
                    <p>Oi this has hidden at the bottom of my inbox for a while now. After a few lazy days of break (eating/napping/movies/repeat) i'm ready to wake up! Hope you are having a Merry Christmas (if you celebrate christmas)!</p>
                    <p>If you are still looking for your next gig...</p>
                    <p>I think you could actually sell yourself as a few different types of role. UX designer. Front-end developer. Front-end prototyper. UI/Visual designer. Sigh isn't our profession confusing? <strong>Actually, you are actually the infamous unicorn designer.</strong></p> 
                    <p>How would you fill out this chart? I found Irene Au's medium posts (written for design employers) actually really useful for my own self reflection as a designer. <a href="https://medium.com/@ireneau/writing-a-job-description-for-ux-people-bcad01be93b0" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@ireneau/writing-a-job-description-for-ux-people-bcad01be93b0</a></p>
                    <p class="center-text"><img src="images/competency.png"></p>
                    <p>Based on this, i'm happy to flag any job postings I hear of. I find by just having an updated portfolio online and an up to date linkedin, i get a few inbound requests, though most of them aren't mission-driven companies or solving interesting/meaningful problems. </p>
                    <p>If you are looking for short-term contract gigs, it might be helpful to reach out to some of the design recruiters in the area. I've only known these ladies personally (from frog days), <a href="http://www.talent-farm.com/" target="_blank">http://www.talent-farm.com/</a> - ex frog recruiters</p>
                    <p>But i've heard good things about some of these recruiters:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="http://www.wertco.com/" target="_blank">Judy Wert</a> specializes in product design leaders and leadership roles</li>
                      <li><a href="https://about.me/amyjacksontalent" target="_blank">Amy Jackson</a> specializes in individual contributor roles for product design</li>
                      <li><a href="http://www.designrecruiter.com/" target="_blank">Stephanie Shapiro</a></li>
                      <li><a href="http://aquent.com/" target="_blank">Aquent</a> specializes in visual design talent</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>They will probably ask to see a portfolio and resume. I'm not sure what type of portfolio you need as a visual designer or front-end developer, but here are some of my favorite UX designer portfolios. Mine is definitely not up to par right now, but i'm hoping to update mine in the next year:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Andrew Kim designer from Art Center: <a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/america-elect">http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/america-elect</a></li>
                      <li>Pinterest ux designer from cmu: <a href="http://www.jedmund.com/">http://www.jedmund.com/</a></li>
                      <li>Jawbox ux designer - uses squarespace: <a href="http://dayn-wilberding.squarespace.com/#/the-jawbone-app/">http://dayn-wilberding.squarespace.com/#/the-jawbone-app/</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Hope that's helpful Aaron. Happy to meet up after the holidays in SF to catchup as well!</p>
                    <p>Cheers and hugs,</p>

              <h2>Work with me!</h2>
               <p>In February of 2015, I left the company I helped start after it sold to NRG, an East Coast energy provider. Since then my time has been spent building. I've been helping friends work on their top-secret startups.</p>
               <p>But I like to stay busy, and so have been taking on contract work. I've worked with big companies like IDEO recently, but also a number of smaller companies and startups like Nipun Capital and Sighten. It's been really great to work on such a diverse set of ideas.</p>

                      <p>Chris and I were good friends when we started Thoughtpool together. By the time Thoughtpool was shut down, we had become great friends. Thoughtpool was a huge learning experience for both of us. We were managing a real business!</p>
                      <p>The original product we wanted to build was soon shelved. We focused on building websites for other people. Business was great. We learned how to manage clients, finances, employees and the whole gamut. The one thing that became more difficult as time went on, was focusing on the products that we had come together to build in the first place.</p>

               <p>My father grew up all over the city.

                </h2>       
                <p>I've worked on many products and brought a few from inception all the way to market and beyond. The last company I helped build from the ground up recently sold for over $100m.</p>
                <p>It may seem trite to say, but I really do approach every challenge while wearing the user's shoes. Once you spend enough time in those shoes, you realize that most of the time, a good product is a good experience, and designing great experiences is something I excel at.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>Designing helpful and intuitive interfaces is pretty much my favorite type of work. Each product is a riddle without an answer, and the process of teasing out the most effective way to communicate to users and help them to accomplish shared goals is something I relish.</p>
                <p>Because I enjoy interface and interaction design so much, it's naturally where I've acquired large portion of my practical skillset. I've designed interfaces for people from all walks of life.</p>

                <p>I learned to turn my designs into products early on. I have a broad range of skills that allow me to take something from idea stage to production-ready.</p>
                <p>My main strengths are in front-end web development, but I've built products across many different platforms.</p>
                <p>My code is really good for a designer with no CS background, and I know all of the standard trade tools.</p>

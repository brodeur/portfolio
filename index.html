              <h1>I help make<br>dreams come true</h1>
              <p>I'm an artist, interface designer, and front end developer in San Francisco. I've spent the last 7 years making the dream of a successful solar company come true, and now I'm looking for my next mission.</p>
              <p>What's your dream? Maybe I can help make it come true. <a class="orange-btn nav-item" href="#skills">Find out how</a></p>

                <h1>Am I a unicorn?</h1>
                <p>No -- at least I'm not <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/overvalued-unicorn/" target="_blank"><em>that</em> kind of unicorn</a> -- but I do have a set of skills that enable me to perform many of the jobs necessary for getting a digital product to market. In certain situations this set of skills <em>can</em> be pretty magical.</p>
                <p>The idea for the unicorn came from an email discussion where I had asked my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suelynyu">Suelyn</a> for advice on how to describe my broad set of skills. She pointed out that some people would classify me as a <a href="http://www.usabilitycounts.com/2013/07/24/the-unicorn-designer-dilemma-and-how-to-avoid-it/" target="_blank">"unicorn designer"</a>: I can conceive of, research, design and build many types of digital products all by myself.</p>
                <p>I thought, hey that's great: I can draw a unicorn to explain what I do. Problem solved. Seriously, though, Suelyn's email was so helpful I've asked for her permission to include it here -- it's great advice to any designer, and was invaluable to me.</p>
                <p>Thanks, Suelyn!</p>

                  <div class="content">
                    <p>Hey Aaron-</p>
                    <p>Oi this has hidden at the bottom of my inbox for a while now. After a few lazy days of break (eating/napping/movies/repeat) i'm ready to wake up! Hope you are having a Merry Christmas (if you celebrate christmas)!</p>
                    <p>If you are still looking for your next gig...</p>
                    <p>I think you could actually sell yourself as a few different types of role. UX designer. Front-end developer. Front-end prototyper. UI/Visual designer. Sigh isn't our profession confusing? <strong>Actually, you are actually the infamous unicorn designer.</strong></p> 
                    <p>How would you fill out this chart? I found Irene Au's medium posts (written for design employers) actually really useful for my own self reflection as a designer. <a href="https://medium.com/@ireneau/writing-a-job-description-for-ux-people-bcad01be93b0" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@ireneau/writing-a-job-description-for-ux-people-bcad01be93b0</a></p>
                    <p class="center-text"><img src="images/competency.png"></p>
                    <p>Based on this, i'm happy to flag any job postings I hear of. I find by just having an updated portfolio online and an up to date linkedin, i get a few inbound requests, though most of them aren't mission-driven companies or solving interesting/meaningful problems. </p>
                    <p>If you are looking for short-term contract gigs, it might be helpful to reach out to some of the design recruiters in the area. I've only known these ladies personally (from frog days), <a href="http://www.talent-farm.com/" target="_blank">http://www.talent-farm.com/</a> - ex frog recruiters</p>
                    <p>But i've heard good things about some of these recruiters:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="http://www.wertco.com/" target="_blank">Judy Wert</a> specializes in product design leaders and leadership roles</li>
                      <li><a href="https://about.me/amyjacksontalent" target="_blank">Amy Jackson</a> specializes in individual contributor roles for product design</li>
                      <li><a href="http://www.designrecruiter.com/" target="_blank">Stephanie Shapiro</a></li>
                      <li><a href="http://aquent.com/" target="_blank">Aquent</a> specializes in visual design talent</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>They will probably ask to see a portfolio and resume. I'm not sure what type of portfolio you need as a visual designer or front-end developer, but here are some of my favorite UX designer portfolios. Mine is definitely not up to par right now, but i'm hoping to update mine in the next year:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Andrew Kim designer from Art Center: <a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/america-elect">http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/america-elect</a></li>
                      <li>Pinterest ux designer from cmu: <a href="http://www.jedmund.com/">http://www.jedmund.com/</a></li>
                      <li>Jawbox ux designer - uses squarespace: <a href="http://dayn-wilberding.squarespace.com/#/the-jawbone-app/">http://dayn-wilberding.squarespace.com/#/the-jawbone-app/</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Hope that's helpful Aaron. Happy to meet up after the holidays in SF to catchup as well!</p>
                    <p>Cheers and hugs,</p>

                <p>The Anchortree was the logo of my first company, Thoughtpool. It's always been a very special image to me -- it came to me in a dream while backpacking through the Ventana Wilderness alone during a birthday getaway. This is a digital composition of the Anchortree, combining imagery from different parts of the world. The main picture used is one from Bagan, Myanmar, where my partner and I traveled last year.</p>

              <h2>Work with me!</h2>
               <p>In February of 2015, I left the company I helped start after it sold to NRG, an East Coast energy provider. Since then my time has been spent building. I've been helping friends work on their top-secret startups.</p>
               <p>But I like to stay busy, and so have been taking on contract work. I've worked with big companies like IDEO recently, but also a number of smaller companies and startups like Nipun Capital and Sighten. It's been really great to work on such a diverse set of ideas.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>Designing helpful and intuitive interfaces is pretty much my favorite type of work. Each product is a riddle without an answer, and the process of teasing out the most effective way to communicate to users and help them to accomplish shared goals is something I relish.</p>
                <p>Because I enjoy interface and interaction design so much, it's naturally where I've acquired large portion of my practical skillset. I've designed interfaces for people from all walks of life.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>I learned to turn my designs into products early on. I have a broad range of skills that allow me to take something from idea stage to production-ready.</p>
                <p>My main strengths are in front-end web development, but I've built products across many different platforms.</p>
                <p>My code is really good for a designer with no CS background, and I know all of the standard trade tools.</p>

  Welcome to my code. I hope it's not too embarassing. Tips for improvements
  or inquiries should be sent to aaronb@gmail.com
  
  Everything I've made here is free for anyone to reproduce and to use. There
  are a number of things on the site subject to copyright or trademark, but
  I think it's pretty clear which things those are.
  
  Everything else is made by me. Right?! Including the unicorn. So feel free
  to take and use as liberally as you'd like. Please, though, nothing evil
  or deeply nefarious.
  
  If something you saw here helped you make up your mind about me, please
  let me know: I love to learn where I'm strong and where I need to improve.

  Since you're looking here, there are two easter eggs and here is a thinly
  vielded clue:
  
    Upon the single horn of blazing gold
    place your finger for truth to be told

    Feel the drape across the miracle's back
    a flag of a mighty tree, framed in black

                <h1>Am I a unicorn?</h1>
                <p>No -- at least I'm not <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/technology/overvalued-in-silicon-valley-but-not-the-word-that-must-not-be-uttered.html" target="_blank"><em>that</em> kind of unicorn</a> -- but I do have a set of skills that enable me to perform many of the jobs necessary for getting a digital product to market. In certain situations this set of skills <em>can</em> be pretty magical.</p>
                <p>The idea for the unicorn came from an email discussion where I had asked my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suelynyu">Suelyn</a> for advice on how to describe my broad set of skills. She pointed out that some people would classify me as a <a href="http://www.usabilitycounts.com/2013/07/24/the-unicorn-designer-dilemma-and-how-to-avoid-it/" target="_blank">"unicorn designer"</a>: I can conceive of, research, design and build many types of digital products all by myself.</p>
                <p>I thought, hey that's great: I can draw a unicorn to explain what I do. Problem solved. Seriously, though, Suelyn's email was so helpful I've asked for her permission to include it here -- it's great advice to any designer, and was invaluable to me.</p>
                <p>Thanks, Suelyn!</p>

                  <div class="content">
                    <p>Hey Aaron-</p>
                    <p>Oi this has hidden at the bottom of my inbox for a while now. After a few lazy days of break (eating/napping/movies/repeat) i'm ready to wake up! Hope you are having a Merry Christmas (if you celebrate christmas)!</p>
                    <p>If you are still looking for your next gig...</p>
                    <p>I think you could actually sell yourself as a few different types of role. UX designer. Front-end developer. Front-end prototyper. UI/Visual designer. Sigh isn't our profession confusing? <strong>Actually, you are actually the infamous unicorn designer.</strong></p> 
                    <p>How would you fill out this chart? I found Irene Au's medium posts (written for design employers) actually really useful for my own self reflection as a designer. <a href="https://medium.com/@ireneau/writing-a-job-description-for-ux-people-bcad01be93b0" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@ireneau/writing-a-job-description-for-ux-people-bcad01be93b0</a></p>
                    <p class="center-text"><img src="images/competency.png"></p>
                    <p>Based on this, i'm happy to flag any job postings I hear of. I find by just having an updated portfolio online and an up to date linkedin, i get a few inbound requests, though most of them aren't mission-driven companies or solving interesting/meaningful problems. </p>
                    <p>If you are looking for short-term contract gigs, it might be helpful to reach out to some of the design recruiters in the area. I've only known these ladies personally (from frog days), <a href="http://www.talent-farm.com/" target="_blank">http://www.talent-farm.com/</a> - ex frog recruiters</p>
                    <p>But i've heard good things about some of these recruiters:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="http://www.wertco.com/" target="_blank">Judy Wert</a> specializes in product design leaders and leadership roles</li>
                      <li><a href="https://about.me/amyjacksontalent" target="_blank">Amy Jackson</a> specializes in individual contributor roles for product design</li>
                      <li><a href="http://www.designrecruiter.com/" target="_blank">Stephanie Shapiro</a></li>
                      <li><a href="http://aquent.com/" target="_blank">Aquent</a> specializes in visual design talent</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>They will probably ask to see a portfolio and resume. I'm not sure what type of portfolio you need as a visual designer or front-end developer, but here are some of my favorite UX designer portfolios. Mine is definitely not up to par right now, but i'm hoping to update mine in the next year:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Andrew Kim designer from Art Center: <a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/america-elect">http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/america-elect</a></li>
                      <li>Pinterest ux designer from cmu: <a href="http://www.jedmund.com/">http://www.jedmund.com/</a></li>
                      <li>Jawbox ux designer - uses squarespace: <a href="http://dayn-wilberding.squarespace.com/#/the-jawbone-app/">http://dayn-wilberding.squarespace.com/#/the-jawbone-app/</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Hope that's helpful Aaron. Happy to meet up after the holidays in SF to catchup as well!</p>
                    <p>Cheers and hugs,</p>

                <p>The Anchortree was the logo of my first company, Thoughtpool.

              <h2>Work with me!</h2>
               <p>In February of 2015, I left <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Block_Off_the_Grid">the company</a> I helped start in 2008 after it sold to <a href="http://www.nrg.com/">NRG</a>, an East Coast energy provider and Fortune 250 company. Since then I've been contracting for various companies and cooking up some projects of my own.</p>
               <p>Recently, I've consulted for big names like IDEO on products that won't be released until 2025, but I've also been able to work with early, growth stage companies like Sighten. Being a consultant has been a great change of pace: It's been really exciting to work with so many talented teams on such a diverse range of ideas.</p>
               <p>Between contracts, I've helped several friends develop new businesses as well as honing several of my own ideas like Thesio, a new way of writing and creating complex documents. From Thesio came a prototype of a javascript library I'm working on, called <a href="http://familiar.pw">Familiar</a>. I'm also collaborating with friends on projects like <a href="http://arbit.us/">Arbitus</a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAD-JpUByU2wRvqWdP8OxSmec1gk7Mg-hJI">Tim</a>, an ultra-super-top-secret project that seeks to eliminate soft costs in solar lead acquisition. Then there's <a href="http://everythingunlimited.co/">Everything Unlimited</a> where I'm collaborating with my best friend -- and former boss -- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tibet-sprague-a135622">Tibet</a> and my partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taniaku">Tania</a>, which is an idea we've been working on for a while around making the workplace more equitable.</p>
               <p>I'm available for hire and collaboration. If you think we'd get along, I'd love to hear about what you're building: <a class="contact-me"></a></p>

              <h2>The startup curve</h2>
               <p>I helped to grow, lead and design One Block Off the Grid through the <a href="http://avc.com/2012/03/the-startup-curve/">startup curve</a>. Our own personal trough of sorrows came in the years after the time when Solyndra, an experimental solar technology company, very publicly encountered problems and went under.</p>
               <p>Funding for solar dried up immediately: There was less awareness then about how much of a no-brainer the technology is. But still we grew. Our peers and partners (the biggest names in the industry) also grew. As we grew, new financing models became available and 1BOG pivoted: Instead of group discounts and consumer advocacy, we would be the Expedia of solar.</p>
               <p>We built a suite of advanced tools that the rest of the industry adopted soon thereafter. We built slick internal tools that made our time-to-call and other metrics the best in the industry. We were killing it! But funding was still scarce, so we ended up merging with PURE Energies.</p>
               <p>PURE Energies is a Canadian company: They brought money and a talented salesforce to the table, we brought our technology stack, customer acquisition expertise and seasoned sales team to the table. Together, we formed and built a company that sold to NRG just a couple of years later for 9 digits.</p>

This was before Groupon, and it spread like wildfire. Suddenly, solar was much more affordable and 1BOG was taking off.</p>
               <p>It became clear that we had a winner on our hands, and so Virgance became 1BOG.</p>
               <p>Over the next 4 years, we would build an incredible company employing around 140 people in San Francisco and Toronto. We were in the sweet spot, providing benefits to both the solar industry and directly to consumers, passing on savings and knowledge in the process.</p>
               <p>I designed everything from consumer-facing solar calculators to full spread newspaper advertisements to the internal tools and quote production/management software. Even though we had switched from many companies to one, as the sole designer for much of the time I was privileged to have a diverse set of interesting problems to solve.</p>

              <h2>Designing an Incubator</h2>
              <p> I joined the founding team of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/02/11/virgance-harnessing-the-community-to-save-the-world-business-plan-included/">Virgance</a> in the late summer of 2008. It was there that I earned my stripes. Virgance was an incubator for socially good companies. At this point in time, incubators weren't the hip thing they are today, but we were on a mission: Let's prove to the world that you can make money and do good at the same time.</p>
              <p>We started with four business units: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrotmob">Carrotmob</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Block_Off_the_Grid">One Block Off the Grid (1BOG)</a>, <a href="http://whitscott.com/2008/04/02/green-options-media-meet-david-anderson/">Green Options Media</a>, Lend and Greenfund. I was the sole designer and front end developer for most of these products, and I felt like a kid in a candy store. Over the next few years, I would work on everything from novel voting interfaces for volunteers around the globe to designing a blogging platform for green bloggers. We raised a $750k seed round, then our Series A. Things were going great.</p>
              <p>Each of our businesses was gaining traction, maturing and in most cases, making money. The one unit of the company that grew the most and the fastest was One Block Off the Grid.</p>

                    <span>After all the work we did, our partners got cold feet: Nobody wanted to put their money where their mouths were and "social media" was still new: Nobody understood the potential impact just then of what Facebook platforms could give to brands. Nobody signed for our initial campaign and we eventually had to conclude that Lend was not destined for this earth. A year later, Pepsi came out with the Refresh campaign, which was a bit of a slap in the face: Pepsi Refresh was Lend.</span>

              <h2>Finding my calling</h2>
              <p>Building Thoughtpool with my co-founder Chris was an incredible learning experience and a big turning point for me. One day, we were pitching an investor and were told, effectively: If you can convince an expert in the field to join your company, I'll give you money. We couldn't make it happen so, I decided I needed to up my game.</p>
              <p>I made a commitment to myself that the next time I tried to build something, I would be better prepared. I had to find people who had done this before who could teach me.</p>
              <p>I found <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAA58MsBhAvAF47mY8DMfiV16QP2hhT5VsE">Brent Schulkin</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAATpOgBZexmKPqvT_FT-yD13np7R-UjHQ0">Steve Newcomb</a> accidentally. I saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DBY5ljAtRE">video</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrotmob">Carrotmob</a>, and reached out to it's founder, Brent, to offer my services. What a great idea that could improve the world!</p>
              <p>Within a couple of months I was the first employee (or third, depending on how you count: I'm looking at you, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAFxjw0Brrez6Sv1aOy8dB9_bRMorXFK3-s" target="_blank">Brad</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAHK0-cB0BbxWvuFY-TY_J_yiPzEWOy9BBU">Natasha</a>) of Virgance, an incubator for social-good companies and, for much of the company's following 7 years, it's only designer and front end developer.</p>

                      <p>Brent is a Stanford grad, activist, founder of global movements, startups and an incredible communicator and good hearted person to boot.</p>
                      <p>Brent started it all for me, when I watched a video of his first Carrotmob event in San Francisco. I reached out to him and within a couple of months was joining this crazy new startup that was going to CHANGE. THE. WORLD.</p>
                      <p>I've learned a lot from Brent over the years: He's an incredible leader who brings out earnest effort in everyone around him while somehow helping everyone to keep their eye on the prize and have lofty goals.</p>
                      <p>Lately I've had the chance to work with Brent again on his next venture, which is at this point disappointingly top secret but so very very exciting.</p>

              <h2>Learning to hustle</h2>
               <p>I worked on websites and graphic for friends and family in my late teens while going to college. There wasn't an endless supply of work, so I also worked as an apprentice plumber and electrician in San Francisco during that time, learning about how things fit together physically. At the time, I was surprised to learn that the way computers worked and the way the real world worked were fundamentally the same. I didn't realize it then, but I was learning valuable design skills at that job.</p>
               <p>My first venture was with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ADEAAAM2TsMBqYQxfClZp_LwSaWfaRyZpHiWHxo">Jacob Lecuyer</a> and it was called <em>Whatizreal?</em>. We were a two man agency, specializing in web design and marketing collateral. Both designers and web developers, we worked for clients all throughout the country.</p>
               <p>After the bubble burst, work dried up. I took a break from the internet for a while and worked at a fancy hotel called The Clift. Then, one day a new contract from an old client came up and gave me a way out of the service industry. A few months later, my then good friend and now brother in law, Chris Strawser and I started <a href="http://thoughtpool.net">Thoughtpool</a>. We had grand visions for a few products and even made serious headway on one of them. Ultimately though, we ran out of money and decided to dissolve Thoughtpool.</p>

But at first, we lived in a commune. Then, my parents <a class="slideshow-link" slide-id="second"><em></em> found a spot</a> near Lake Merced with a big backyard and rope swings and chickens and goats. Yup, goats.</p>
               <p><a class="slideshow-link" slide-id="third"><em></em> I was homeschooled</a> and so was able to graduate "high school" early and go to college at 16. I didn't study much about what I do now, but that's when I began investing my time into learning how the internet worked. My best friend Levi and I built our first websites together-a SWATCH sales portal and a corporate website for his brother's climbing gym company. It felt like magic, then, to make money building things that lived on the internet.</p>
               <p>I was able to work briefly with a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAtvSfIBY2RvfFzACbU0OedzwN-6sgHkm9k">family friend</a> whose company sold to Yahoo for over $500,000,000 and I was hooked -- things were changing so rapidly in our hometown and opportunity was everywhere.</p>

Not only was the work interesting and challenging -- being an intern was a new experience for me -- but the office had daily Marathon (a video game) tournaments.</p>
                      <p>Shamrock made multimedia marketing materials that were intended to be bundled marketing materials. While I was there, the company was working on an interactive 3D video game for Chrysler -- something pretty advanced for it's time.</p>

                <p>It may seem trite to say, but I really do approach every challenge while wearing the user's shoes. Once you spend enough time in those shoes, you realize that most of the time, a good product is a good experience, and designing great experiences is something I excel at.</p>

                <p>Designing helpful and intuitive interfaces is pretty much my favorite type of work. Each product is a riddle without an answer, and the process of teasing out the most effective way to communicate to users and help them to accomplish shared goals is something I relish.</p>
                <p>Because I enjoy interface and interaction design so much, it's naturally where I've acquired large portion of my practical skillset. I've designed interfaces for people from all walks of life.</p>

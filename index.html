              <h1>I help make<br>dreams come true</h1>
              <p>I'm an artist, interface designer, and front end developer in San Francisco. I've spent the last 7 years making the dream of a successful solar company come true, and now I'm looking for my next mission.</p>
              <p>What's your dream? Maybe I can help make it come true. <a class="orange-btn nav-item" href="#skills">Find out how</a></p>

                <h1>Am I a unicorn?</h1>
                <p>No -- at least I'm not <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/technology/overvalued-in-silicon-valley-but-not-the-word-that-must-not-be-uttered.html" target="_blank"><em>that</em> kind of unicorn</a> -- but I do have a set of skills that enable me to perform many of the jobs necessary for getting a digital product to market. In certain situations this set of skills <em>can</em> be pretty magical.</p>
                <p>The idea for the unicorn came from an email discussion where I had asked my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/suelynyu">Suelyn</a> for advice on how to describe my broad set of skills. She pointed out that some people would classify me as a <a href="http://www.usabilitycounts.com/2013/07/24/the-unicorn-designer-dilemma-and-how-to-avoid-it/" target="_blank">"unicorn designer"</a>: I can conceive of, research, design and build many types of digital products all by myself.</p>
                <p>I thought, hey that's great: I can draw a unicorn to explain what I do. Problem solved. Seriously, though, Suelyn's email was so helpful I've asked for her permission to include it here -- it's great advice to any designer, and was invaluable to me.</p>
                <p>Thanks, Suelyn!</p>

                  <div class="content">
                    <p>Hey Aaron-</p>
                    <p>Oi this has hidden at the bottom of my inbox for a while now. After a few lazy days of break (eating/napping/movies/repeat) i'm ready to wake up! Hope you are having a Merry Christmas (if you celebrate christmas)!</p>
                    <p>If you are still looking for your next gig...</p>
                    <p>I think you could actually sell yourself as a few different types of role. UX designer. Front-end developer. Front-end prototyper. UI/Visual designer. Sigh isn't our profession confusing? <strong>Actually, you are actually the infamous unicorn designer.</strong></p> 
                    <p>How would you fill out this chart? I found Irene Au's medium posts (written for design employers) actually really useful for my own self reflection as a designer. <a href="https://medium.com/@ireneau/writing-a-job-description-for-ux-people-bcad01be93b0" target="_blank">https://medium.com/@ireneau/writing-a-job-description-for-ux-people-bcad01be93b0</a></p>
                    <p class="center-text"><img src="images/competency.png"></p>
                    <p>Based on this, i'm happy to flag any job postings I hear of. I find by just having an updated portfolio online and an up to date linkedin, i get a few inbound requests, though most of them aren't mission-driven companies or solving interesting/meaningful problems. </p>
                    <p>If you are looking for short-term contract gigs, it might be helpful to reach out to some of the design recruiters in the area. I've only known these ladies personally (from frog days), <a href="http://www.talent-farm.com/" target="_blank">http://www.talent-farm.com/</a> - ex frog recruiters</p>
                    <p>But i've heard good things about some of these recruiters:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="http://www.wertco.com/" target="_blank">Judy Wert</a> specializes in product design leaders and leadership roles</li>
                      <li><a href="https://about.me/amyjacksontalent" target="_blank">Amy Jackson</a> specializes in individual contributor roles for product design</li>
                      <li><a href="http://www.designrecruiter.com/" target="_blank">Stephanie Shapiro</a></li>
                      <li><a href="http://aquent.com/" target="_blank">Aquent</a> specializes in visual design talent</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>They will probably ask to see a portfolio and resume. I'm not sure what type of portfolio you need as a visual designer or front-end developer, but here are some of my favorite UX designer portfolios. Mine is definitely not up to par right now, but i'm hoping to update mine in the next year:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Andrew Kim designer from Art Center: <a href="http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/america-elect">http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/america-elect</a></li>
                      <li>Pinterest ux designer from cmu: <a href="http://www.jedmund.com/">http://www.jedmund.com/</a></li>
                      <li>Jawbox ux designer - uses squarespace: <a href="http://dayn-wilberding.squarespace.com/#/the-jawbone-app/">http://dayn-wilberding.squarespace.com/#/the-jawbone-app/</a></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Hope that's helpful Aaron. Happy to meet up after the holidays in SF to catchup as well!</p>
                    <p>Cheers and hugs,</p>

                <p>The Anchortree was the logo of my first company, Thoughtpool. It's always been a very special image to me -- it came to me in a dream while backpacking through the Ventana Wilderness alone during a birthday getaway. This is a digital composition of the Anchortree, combining imagery from different parts of the world. The main picture used is one from Bagan, Myanmar, where my partner and I traveled last year.</p>

              <h2>Work with me!</h2>
               <p>In February of 2015, I left <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Block_Off_the_Grid">the company</a> I helped start in 2008 after it sold to <a href="http://www.nrg.com/">NRG</a>, an East Coast energy provider and Fortune 250 company. Since then I've been contracting for various companies and cooking up some projects of my own.</p>
               <p>I've worked with big companies like IDEO recently, but also a number of smaller companies and startups like Nipun Capital and Sighten. After 5 years of working on one product, it's been really exciting to work with so many talented teams on such a diverse range of ideas.</p>
               <p>Between contracts, I have been working on helping several friends develop new businesses as well as developing several of my own ideas like Thesio, a new way of writing and creating complex or long documents. I'm also collaborating with a couple of people on projects like Arbitus with my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAD-JpUByU2wRvqWdP8OxSmec1gk7Mg-hJI">Tim</a>, an ultra-top-secret project that seeks to eliminate soft costs in solar lead acquisition.</p>
               <p>I've also been more involved in my community, lending my skills to organizations that are helping to create a more awesome world.</p>
               <p>I'm available for work. If you are building a digital product and really want it to shine, I'd love to hear from you to see if we can build it together.</p>

              <h2>The startup curve</h2>
               <p>I helped to grow, lead and design One Block Off the Grid through the <a href="http://avc.com/2012/03/the-startup-curve/">startup curve</a>. Our own personal trough of sorrows came in the years after the time when Solyndra, an experimental solar technology company, very publicly encountered problems and went under.</p>
               <p>Funding for solar dried up immediately: There was less awareness then about how much of a no-brainer the technology is. But still we grew. Our peers and partners (the biggest names in the industry) also grew. As we grew, new financing models became available and 1BOG pivoted: Instead of group discounts and consumer advocacy, we would be the Expedia of solar.</p>
               <p>We built a suite of advanced tools that the rest of the industry adopted soon thereafter. We built slick internal tools that made our time-to-call and other metrics the best in the industry. We were killing it! But funding was still scarce, so we ended up merging with PURE Energies.</p>
               <p>PURE Energies is a Canadian company: They brought money and a talented salesforce to the table, we brought our technology stack, customer acquisition expertise and seasoned sales team to the table. Together, we formed and built a company that sold to NRG just a couple of years later for 9 digits.</p>

              <h2>The solar revolution</h2>
               <p>After two years of successfully running an incubator, it was clear that only one of our products had the potential for big success: One Block Off the Grid (1BOG) was making money and acquiring users and a really surprising pace.</p>
               <p>Virgance dissolved it's assets and returned the products we built to the people who had worked on them, and most of the staff joined 1BOG. We were pivoting, and we aimed to be the consumer brand for residential solar in the United States.</p>
               <p>Over the next 4 years, we would build an incredible company employing around 80 people in San Francisco, people in Brazil, Toronto and other places. We had built a company that provided benefits to both the solar industry and directly to consumers, passing on savings and knowledge in the process.</p>
               <p>I designed everything from consumer-facing solar calculators to full spread newspaper advertisements to the internal tools and quote production/management software. Even though we had switched from many companies to one, as the sole designer for much of the time I was privileged to have a diverse set of interesting problems to solve.</p>

              <h2>Designing an Incubator</h2>
              <p> I joined the founding team of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/02/11/virgance-harnessing-the-community-to-save-the-world-business-plan-included/">Virgance</a> in the late summer of 2008. It was there that I earned my stripes. Virgance was an incubator for socially good companies. At this point in time, incubators weren't the hip thing they are today, but we were on a mission: Let's prove to the world that you can make money and do good at the same time. The world was at a tipping point: The iPhone had just come out and Obama had just been elected.</p>
              <p>We started out with four business units. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrotmob">Carrotmob</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Block_Off_the_Grid">One Block Off the Grid (1BOG)</a>, <a href="http://whitscott.com/2008/04/02/green-options-media-meet-david-anderson/">Green Options Media</a>, Lend and Greenfund. I was the sole designer and front end developer for most of these products, and I felt like a kid in a candy store. Over the next few years, I would work on everything from novel voting interfaces for volunteers around the globe to designing a blogging platform for green bloggers. We raised seed, then our Series A. Things were going great.</p>
              <p>Not only were we getting some traction in some of our businesses, but the market and investors were signaling to us that what we were building had value. The one unit of the company that grew the most and the fastest was One Block Off the Grid.</p>
              <p>It started out with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAAAUY0BBOQNF5YQx5mIWDfHzyTs5ujpLZU">Dan Barahona</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAAAUZIBBmeNG2Gpa_QBFtHVA5cDga41-iY">Sylvia Ventura</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAADcr74BtHwEVw97S1mx2s8onf43V-_N7M4">Dave Llorens</a> organizing a neighborhood together to get a significant discount on solar, which at that time was still paid for in cash. This form of group discount was really popular and 1BOG was spreading it around the country.</p>

              <h2>Finding my calling</h2>
              <p>Building Thoughtpool with my co-founder Chris was an incredible learning experience and a big turning point for me: When it didn't work out, I decided I needed to up my game.</p>
              <p>The biggest turning point was when we were pitching an investor and were told, effectively: If you can convince an expert in the field to join your company, I'll give you money.</p>
              <p>We didn't end up being able to do it, and I made a commitment to myself that the next time I tried to build something, I would be better prepared. I had to find people who had done this before who could teach me.</p>
              <p>I found <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAA58MsBhAvAF47mY8DMfiV16QP2hhT5VsE">Brent Schulkin</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAATpOgBZexmKPqvT_FT-yD13np7R-UjHQ0">Steve Newcomb</a> accidentally. I saw a video about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrotmob">Carrotmob</a>, and reached out to it's founder, Brent, to offer my services. What a great idea that could improve the world!</p>
              <p>Within a couple of months I was the first employee (or third, depending on how you count: I'm looking at you, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAFxjw0Brrez6Sv1aOy8dB9_bRMorXFK3-s" target="_blank">Brad</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAHK0-cB0BbxWvuFY-TY_J_yiPzEWOy9BBU">Natasha</a>) of Virgance, an incubator for social-good companies and, for much of the company's following 7 years, it's only designer and front end developer.</p>

              <h2>Learning to hustle</h2>
               <p>I worked on websites and graphic for friends and family in my late teens while going to college. But it wasn't an endless supply of work -- it was hard to hunt down projects.</p>
               <p>I also worked as an apprentice plumber and electrician in San Francisco during that time, learning about how things fit together physically. Surprisingly, to me at least, the way computers worked and the way buildings worked were pretty similar. I didn't realize it then, but I was learning valuable design skills at that job.</p>
               <p>My first venture was with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=ADEAAAM2TsMBqYQxfClZp_LwSaWfaRyZpHiWHxo">Jacob Lecuyer</a> and it was called <em>Whatizreal?</em> -- neither of us had learned much about branding at that point, but I'd like to point out that there is <em>still</em> a company called Yahoo!. We were an agency, effectively. Both designers and web developers, we worked for clients all throughout the country.</p>
               <p>After the bubble burst, work dried up. I took a break from the internet for a while and worked at a fancy hotel called The Clift. But one day a new contract from an old client came up and gave me a way out of the service industry.</p>
               <p>A few months later, my then good friend and now brother in law, Chris Strawser and I started Thoughtpool. We had grand visions for a few products and even made serious headway on one of them. Ultimately though, we ran out of money and decided to dissolve Thoughtpool.</p>

              <h2>The early years</h2>
               <p>My father grew up all over the city. When he met my Southern Californian mother, they married and became <a class="slideshow-link" slide-id="first"><em></em> hippie Christian ministers</a> here, and over the course of 35 years, they ended up leading the largest congregation in the city. But at first, we lived in a commune. Then, my parents <a class="slideshow-link" slide-id="second"><em></em> found a spot</a> near Lake Merced with a big backyard and rope swings and chickens and goats. Yup, goats.</p>
               <p><a class="slideshow-link" slide-id="third"><em></em> I was homeschooled</a> and so was able to graduate "high school" early and go to college at 16. I didn't study much about what I do now, but that's when I began investing my time into learning how the internet worked. My best friend Levi and I built our first websites together-a SWATCH sales portal and a corporate website for his brother's climbing gym company. It felt like magic, then, to make money building things that lived on the internet.</p>
               <p>I was able to work briefly with a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAkAAAtvSfIBY2RvfFzACbU0OedzwN-6sgHkm9k">family friend</a> whose company sold to Yahoo for over $500,000,000 and I was hooked -- things were changing so rapidly in our hometown and opportunity was everywhere.</p>
               <p>It was at about 16 when I started regularly building websites and doing graphic design for friends and family. At this point in time, just before the bubble popped, the internet was still brand new and seemed like a magical money machine.</p>
